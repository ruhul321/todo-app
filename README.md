ðŸš€ Heads Up: App May Take a Few Seconds to Load Initially
When you first open the app or return after some time of inactivity, it might take a few seconds for the content (like your to-do lists) to appear. This is due to a cold start â€” a delay caused when the backend server "wakes up" from sleep.

ðŸ›  Why this happens:
The backend is hosted using the free tier of Vercel, which puts serverless functions to sleep when they're inactive to conserve resources. When a user accesses the app again, it takes a short moment to spin everything back up.

Once the server is warm, the app will respond much faster. Thanks for your patience and understanding!
